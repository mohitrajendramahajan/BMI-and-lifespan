# BMI-and-lifespan
Project which tells us about the life expectancy of the person on the bases of its basic medical data such as Alcohol, BMI, Polio, Total expenditure, Diphtheria, Income composition of resources etc.:
📊 BMI and Lifespan Prediction Model
This project explores the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and life expectancy, using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand how BMI correlates with lifespan and to build predictive models that estimate life expectancy based on BMI and related features.

🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains:
• 	Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
• 	Visualization of BMI vs. lifespan trends
• 	Multiple machine learning models
• 	Model evaluation and comparison
• 	Insights and interpretation of results
The notebook walks through the full workflow — from raw data to a trained predictive model.

📁 Repository Structure


📦 Requirements
To run this project locally, install the following Python libraries:


🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The notebook includes:
• 	Distribution of BMI and lifespan
• 	Scatter plots and correlation heatmaps
• 	Outlier detection
• 	Feature relationships and trends
These visualizations help uncover patterns and guide model selection.

🤖 Machine Learning Models
The following models were trained and evaluated:
• 	Linear Regression
• 	Random Forest Regressor
• 	Gradient Boosting Regressor
• 	MLP Regressor (Neural Network)
Each model was compared using metrics such as:
• 	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
• 	Mean Squared Error (MSE)
• 	R² Score

✅ Results
The notebook summarizes:
• 	Which model performed best
• 	How BMI influences lifespan
• 	Key insights from the data
• 	Limitations and considerations
(You can add exact numbers once you finalize the notebook.)

📈 Visualizations
The project includes:
• 	BMI vs. Life Expectancy scatter plots
• 	Feature importance charts
• 	Model performance comparison graphs
These help interpret the model and understand the underlying data.

🧠 Key Insights
• 	BMI shows a measurable relationship with lifespan.
• 	Non-linear models (like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting) often capture patterns better than simple linear models.
• 	Feature engineering and data quality significantly impact prediction accuracy.

📌 Future Improvements
• 	Add more health-related features (diet, activity level, smoking, etc.)
• 	Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
• 	Deploy the model as an API or web app
• 	Add cross-validation and SHAP explainability
